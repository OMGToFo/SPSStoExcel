Unfortunatlely it get's shut down now and then, i think due to data usage limits

I think that SPSS still has a very efficent way for viewing and analyzing data sets. The possibility to easily switch betwen raw data, labelled data and variable definitions is still unique and very convenient. In this app you can at least export the different SPSS views to excel. i also added some basic options for statistical analysis and tabulations, hope to improve the possibilities over time.

Local Usage

To use this app locally on your computer, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies by running the command pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Run the app by typing streamlit run app.py in your terminal.
- Select the SPSS file you want to view.
- Once the file is loaded, you can view it on the main panel.Sometimes it takes some time o load and convert the SPSS-File
- If you want to save the file as an Excel file, simply click on the "Save as Excel" button.

That's it! This app should make it easy and convenient to view SPSS files and convert them to Excel files. Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs, and please let me (tomas@hotmail.ch) know if you have any issues or feedback. Enjoy!
