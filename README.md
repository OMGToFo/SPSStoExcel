# SPSStoExcel
This is a super simple "app" that let's you view SPSS Files and export the data with or without the labels. 
I find that SPSS still has a very efficent way for viewing and analyzing data sets. The possibility to easily switch betwen raw data, labelled data and variable definitions is still unique and very convenient. In this app you can at least export the different SPSS views to excel.
